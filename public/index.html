Team PACK CHALLENGE – HOW IT WORKS
Enter your name and email to receive your Team Pack.
Each person may register only once per event.
If you try to register again using the same email, you will not receive a new pack. Instead, you will be shown your original four teams.
YOUR Team PACK
When you sign up, you are randomly assigned 4 teams.

Each pack includes:

1 team seeded 1–3
1 team seeded 4–6
1 team seeded 7–10
1 team seeded 11–16
No more than 2 teams from the same region.
None of your teams will play each other in the first round.
No two participants will have the same 4-team combination.
HOW YOU SCORE
You earn points when your ORIGINAL four teams win.

Base Points Per Round:

Round of 64 = 1 point
Round of 32 = 2 points
Sweet 16 = 4 points
Elite 8 = 7 points
Final Four = 12 points
Championship = 20 points
Upset Bonus:

If your team beats a higher seed, you earn bonus points equal to: Opponent seed minus your seed (maximum 10 bonus points).

Example: A 12 seed beats a 5 seed = 7 bonus points.

WEEKLY WINNERS
Week 1: Round of 64 + Round of 32 ($50 / $25 / $10)
Week 2: Sweet 16 + Elite 8 ($50 / $25 / $10)
Week 3: Final Four + Championship ($50 / $25 / $10)
Each week has its own winner based on points scored during that week.

WEEK 2 BONUS TEAM
At the start of Week 2, anyone who has lost at least one original team will receive one additional Bonus Team from the remaining field.

The Bonus Team counts toward Week 2 and 3 scoring only
Does NOT count toward your overall total
This keeps everyone competitive heading into the second weekend.

OVERALL WINNER
The Overall Champion is determined by total points from your ORIGINAL four teams only.

The Week 2 Bonus Team does not affect the overall standings.

Overall Winner Prize: $100
